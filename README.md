In our library book management system, I've implemented the view function. This functionality allows users to view existing book records stored in the database. When users access the book management section through the admin dashboard, they can click on the 'View Books' button, the display of a table containing fields such as book ID, name, author, and book type. These implement greatly improve the system's user-friendliness by offering extensive features for managing books. I've also implemented a SQL Exception to handle situations where data retrieval from the database fails.
